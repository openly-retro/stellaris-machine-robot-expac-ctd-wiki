=============================

- Fix scripted triggers that control when traits can be added to the ruler and councilors, via the Core Modifying and Councilor Editor GUIs. This should solve the long-running issue of traits presenting as clickable and then doing nothing when clicked.
- Changing the ruler subclass via Core Modifying GUI doesn't cost any points, but does still cost resources
- Fixed Auto-Society research building not producing any society research when upgraded (thanks KeterKadmon for the bug report)
- Fixed World-Machine empires with Tactical Algorithms not starting with an Auto-Military Academy
- Fixed Gestalt councilor portraits missing in the Councilor Editor GUIs
