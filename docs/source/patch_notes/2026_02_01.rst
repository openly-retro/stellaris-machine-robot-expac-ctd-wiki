=============================

Mod version 3.0.11

- Fixed Mind Separation project completion event not firing because there is no completed project in the log
- Fixed Mechanical World decision not working as expected, because it was changing the planet class to a placeholder/dummy class and that method is not necessary anymore
- Distributed Multikernel AP (vassals for machine gestalts) was being stopped by a base game rule "can_release_vassal", which I overwrote to let Machine empires with this AP release vassals, even though the rule "can_release_vassal_from_species" was working but still blocked releasing vassals (because of "can_release_vassal").
- Triggers for adding/removing genetic traits from species got updated, they were slightly out of date with what is in the base game
