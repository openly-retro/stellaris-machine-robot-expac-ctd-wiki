Leader Assembly
---------------

Assemble machine leaders using a unique GUI interface. (Paragons DLC
required)

Once the required research is completed, a new edict becomes available
that triggers the GUI. Adding and removing traits costs resources, and
for balance, a trait “point” system is used, much like species
modification points.

*No longer limited to selecting drones that meet eligibility
requirements, our Machine empire fashions specialized leaders, taking
advantage of the modular nature of technology.*

Ruler Modification
------------------

Add or remove traits as desired with a GUI interface. (Paragons DLC
required)

Much like the leader builder, this GUI focuses on editing the empire’s
ruler. It also uses a traits points system.

*When our empire’s leader becomes outdated, it will be necessary to
retrofit bigger and better modules to govern and conquer.*

Councilor Editor (New in Continuation)
--------------------------------------

-  New tech following Core Modification and Leader Building
-  Custom GUI to edit each councilor, adding and removing traits

   :alt: Councilor Editor is available via edict. Trait additions and removals happen immediately.
