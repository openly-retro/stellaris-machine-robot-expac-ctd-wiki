Machine & Robot Expansion: Continued documentation
==================================================

This mod is a continuation of XVCV's "Machines & Robot Expansion" , which is/was loved by many. A great addon for Machine empire enthusiasts which I loved playing -- it adds a variety of ascension perks, new playstyles, civics, traits, and much-needed love for Machines & Robots!

Unfortunately, since XVCV has left the Stellaris modding scene, the M&RE mod became unsupported. The original mod by XVCV can be found here. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2441507863 

This adaptation/continuation will continue to make the original Machine & Robot Expansion compatible with the latest versions of Stellaris. In addition to bug fixes, new features are being added!

**Only one DLC is required for this mod: Synthetic Dawn** and it will stay that way.
