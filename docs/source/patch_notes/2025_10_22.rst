=============================

This change set includes many fixes from Legit-Rikk; thank you Rikk!
Welcome and thanks to guest contributor, Exasperation!
Special thanks to Krukal (Silvery Mercury) of Doves Localisation Group, for all your help translating this mod's text to Chinese!

Mod version 3.0.8, compatible with Stellaris v4.1.*

Bug fixes (Rikk):
- fix orbital cooling system from overriding cooling limits
- Fixed some localisations which were too long in the planet view
- Fixed a bug with the Dyson Receiver's effect on planets
- synchronization arrays can now be queued
- Machine World planet classes can be converted to Auto-Machine World using a core
- auto_organoid_research_center adds food upkeep to Science districts
- Fixed code recomposition project not granting code recomposition event (it fails the event trigger before the special project is marked as complete)
- A few smaller fixes to make error.log more quiet

Balance & Improvements (Rikk):
- Outer core cooling project takes a lot more time now
- Outer Core cooling deposit, and Outer core Tap deposits have had their bonuses reduced a bit
- World Machine colony designations have been buffed slightly
- Make certain event text more clear, during World Machine improvements special project
- Terraforming from a regular habitable planet to a T3 Machine World (Forge, CPU, Server) will cost 2 World-Machine cores
- Tier 1 of auto-farm, auto-mine, and auto-generator buildings don't have science upkeep (but will have science upkeep on subsequent upgrades)
- Catalytic Converter empires will see their Consumer Goods structures using Food, and also Strategic Resources structures using Food
- World Machine buildings and zones production values have been tweaked (scaled up slightly) to match Phoenix 4.0 base job production values. These may get tweaked again.

New Stuff (Rikk):
- Added auto trade hub starbase building
- Added 3 new zones for energy, minerals, and food districts that take SR upkeep to increase their production

Balance & Improvements (Exasperation):
- Machine Learning civic is now compatible with World Machines
- Fixed starting districts for World Machines when the Planet Cracker civic is selected

Bug Fixes (Retro):
- Resize all building icons to fit Lyra 4.1 standards
- Auto-Factory planet name has been standardized across tooltips
- Wacky scaling issues with unity districts on Auto-Server is fixed
- Self Assembling Colony AP was leaving behind 2 buildings then destroying the lower-tier one, this has been fixed (Reported by Mongolow)
- Bio Mech assembly was skyrocketing since a particular variable was not being reset each month, which let the assembly bonuses go to the moon (Reported by Tarka)
- Bio Mech empires weren't able to remove bio traits (Reported by Arphar) now they can
- Mechanical Planet starts with 200 roboticist jobs, it was missing being scaled up to match 4.0 values (Reported by Arphar) so it was starting with literally 1 roboticist job
- Do not overwrite "mod_planet_bureaucrats_upkeep_mult" (reported by JadeBlood815)
- trigger logic for can_remove_beneficial_traits was excluding Biogenesis DLC players from removing traits.. sorry folks, this should be fixed (reported by JadeBlood815)

Balance & Improvements (Retro):
- Create a unified Industrial colony designation
- Improved Machine tradition pick, added a few new bonuses since +building slots is no longer relevant (Requested by Arphar)

New Stuff (Retro):
- Added research specializations for auto-generator, auto-mining, auto-farming districts
- Add 3 district specializations to World Machines' primary district, for boosting energy, food, and mineral production
- Auto-Factory's Munitions district has 3 zones: Naval cap, ground support (build armies faster, defensive army bonus), and a sublight speed-boosting zone
- Certain zones have new specialization icons
- Flavor text additions in various World Machine planetary buildings
- New Auto-Research buildings, one for each type of research
- Mechanical World has an updated planet background, using the Continental sky instead of the bleak Machine sky
- Some primary district zones will send resource production to the Auto Capital, if those zones would have added jobs in the base game / vanilla version of the zone (because of differences in economic category between planets' primary zones). This is an experiment, and may be changed/removed later.
